/**
* TODO
* + fetch ball straight and search for goal if lost goal at large angle
* + search for goal state
* + search for ball state
* + avoid kicking through another ball
* + improve aiming while spinning around dribbler
* + make it brake less/smarter for fetch front
* + improve fetch behind not to reconsider so much (complete maneuver?)
* + decrease fetch direct speed if white-black close (nearby line)
* + provide cached ball info for some frames if can't see one any more
* + move while aiming if other robot in the way (can be improved)
* + do something if searching for a ball for a while (drive the center)
* + deal with not seeing a ball at distance when starting to fetch it quickly (remembers it for a while)
* + check if sees ball is out driving in reverse
* + check whether adaptive fetch front distance is good
* + can drive out of the field when avoiding to kick through balls
* + don't drive forward while avoiding balls if next ball is close by
* + detect that the robot has gone out of the field (both cameras)
* + create a way to read the actual distance the robot has travelled at any time
* + use robot distance to calculate how long to drive blind behind the ball
* + more reliable "ball in goal", check distances?
* + better reversing out of the corner
* + differentiate between near line and in corner
* + reverse only a little near a line, more in corner, approach with care in both cases
* + don't fake ball in dribbler after kicking
* + can fetch behind be made faster?
* + when aiming, turn around dribbler with acceleration and don't move forward or event slightly reverse at the beginning
* / reverse towards own goal while aiming based on travelledRotation not time
* + come home state, drives to corner based on localization, white lines (eq side distance approach)
* + make sure robot doesn't drive into own goal if balls close to it, over line
* + thinks it's near the line too often when actually not
* + apply max distance on escape from corner
* + search: drive straigh until near line white-black, turn 45 degrees, repeat, turn rotating
* + check turnBy -150.4 degrees
* + need better fetch ball near
* + kicks through other balls if other balls very close
* - make localizer use angle to goal
* - try accelerating dribbler
* + better drive-into-goal avoidance
* / avoid goal collision, sample top quarter area pixels for unsegmented/goal colors, drive left from them
* + check why fetch behind sometimes messes it up (render in web UI)
* / cancel fetch ball behind and escape corner if robot out is detected
* + fake ball in dribbler for more time if escaping corner / always complete it (if not out)
* - ignore camera image if fetching frame takes a long time
* + rotate around its axis when was near any goals lately
* / find ball drive between goals
* - read and check all logic code
* + make returning to field seperate state, use in find ball, fetch ball direct
* + fix find goal, drive towards own when aiming
* + check if kick window calculaton is reasonable
* - don't avoid balls near the goal (distance + bounding box), might bounce both in anyway
* - avoid balls away from the center of the field, not towards (so less new balls will come in the way)
* - fetch ball front offset zero, kick with speed, brake based on goal aim offset
* - path planning to next ball, drive using relative coords and odometry
* - simulator in c++ code, emulates robot and vision, ui might be the same web ui
*
* 2014
* + prefer balls near own goal - faster to move forwards and can get in opponents way
* + prefer balls from the rear camera when opponent goal is visible
* # drive behind the furthest not closest ball behind the robot, avoid hitting other balls on the way
*   > not a good idea, pushes balls that get in the way and can go for a ball outside the field
* + make sure the ball in the way is not too close when chip-kicking
* + chip kick over the furthest ball in the way not based on goal distance - can save some charge in the caps
* + robot starts to push a ball close by at large angle, avoid it
* + make sure that seen goal top outer edges are at large distance (takes distortion into account)
* + implement ball search routine, for example drive between the two goals looking at opponent goal
* + don't look straight at goal when the ball angle is big but between them
* + don't maneuver from balls far away near goal
* + make ball in goal detection better
* + queue serial messages to be sent and send them as a single string at once
* + serial queue message counter does not decrement one by one, sometimes many values
* + debug long dt between frames
* + search from front at the very beginning not to go after a ball seen on the operators hand
* + should prefer balls from the rear more often
* + sometimes high level thinks the dribbler has ball while low-level does not agree
* + robot does not keep picking the next ball behind
* + avoid going for the ball that it just kicked towards the goal
* + fetch ball near chip kick dribbler sometimes is still in the way
* + does outside of field detection work in all states
* + fetch ball behind switches to further and further balls, should probably not
* + sometimes does not choose balls from behind?
* + dribbler thinks it's got the ball some time after bdkick reported kicked ball, should not
* + perhaps should calculate main coilgun duration to get the ball into the goal but not kick too hard
* ¤ dribbler should not report having ball when last kick time is very small
* - should not try to fetch-ball-front (focusing on goal) if the goal and ball distanceX is too large (eg in corner)
* - fetch-ball-near should switch to fetch-ball-direct if goal is obstructed at small ball distance
* - goal should not be not valid only when pathmetrics to center and corners fail
* - detect another robot in the way and avoid kicking into it
* - if got ball and don't see opponents goal, don't just spin in place as the other robot may be in way, focus at own goal from rear and drive from side to side
* - in fetch ball near, if the ball is very close and the kick window is not clear, send no-kick and fetch direct, special care when dribbler up
* - when driving behind ball, check whether the robot fits and if not, drive behind the next ball
* # while performing drive behind ball, it should check whether it has gone out as well
*   > not a good idea, can give up fetching balls on the lines
* ¤ fetch ball direct thinks it's near a line too often and is then very slow
* - improve fetch-ball-near - could be faster and mess up less (still pushes with edge)
* ¤ avoid driving into the goal (watch for gree-white-black distances)
* - fetch first ball using fetch-ball-direct (if near own goal)?
* - prefer balls from behind when front is near a line and sees opponent goal? would spend less time on balls outside
* ¤ sometimes kicks too far for no apparent reason
* - drives through the opponent's goal at the start if the first ball on the left is close to it
* - show apparent goal locations in dash
* - calculate goal distance from center of goal moving down finding first green pixel
* - prepare laptop to compile new code
* - prepare another laptop with better battery to use for dash
* - spin around dribbler while aiming could be accelerating
* - spin around dribbler could be turning around one wrong wheel to always push ball
* - don't go for ball if ball distance is detected negative
*
* Future
* - make all parameters settable in the UI
* - implement logviking-style logging with filterable components
*
* Competition
* - when reversing blind, stop if got too many non-color or black pixels behind (the black matte)
* - reduce goal size to seen edge distance are to aim to correct area
* - PID for lookAt
* - improve ball side speed PID
*
* Testing scenarious
* + fetch ball direct at distance when seeing opponents goal
* + fetch ball direct at distance when not seeing opponents goal
* + fetch ball from in front of own goal facing opponents goal
* + fetch ball from in front of own goal facing own goal
* + fetch ball on the centerline facing own goal so it turns around (should not lose ball)
* + fetch ball very close to own goal (should not turn around the ball into the goal)
* + fetch ball close to own goal from behind
* + fetch ball on the black line in the center of own goal, can push it in and go for it
* + should reverse out of own goal if gets into it
* + should reverse out of opponents goal if gets into it
* + fetch ball behind direct at far distance
* + fetch ball behind direct at small distance
* + fetch ball behind from center edge of the field when in front of opponents goal facing goal directly
* + fetch ball behind from opposite corner should not trigger return to field
* + fetch ball very close to the opponent goal (on the line) at the center
* + fetch ball close to opponents goal corners
* + should roam the field between white lines if no balls are visible
* + should find a ball quickly when roaming around when suddenly becomes visible (remove foot etc)
* + should be able to see a ball from one corner to another from both cameras
* + should not get stuck near a goal if a ball is in the goal and the next ball is far away
* + should drive sideways when got ball near side of goal to make the aiming window bigger
* + should drive sideways and score when got opponent in way at close distance
* + should drive sideways and score when got opponent in way at large distance
* + should be able to steal the ball from opponents jaws, drive sideways and score
* + fetch-ball-near should switch to fetch-ball-direct if goal is obstructed at small ball distance
* + should not try to fetch-ball-front (focusing on goal) if the goal and ball distanceX is too large (eg in corner)
* - fetch a string of balls straight behind each other
* - fetch a string of balls diagonally (both diagonals)
* - fetch ball in opposite corner
* - fetch a string of balls behind robot (large and small gaps)
* - fetch ball on the line while opponents goal is visible
* - fetch ball on the line when goal not visible (do not push out)
* - fetch balls from corners (near own goal and opponents), should back out
* - fetch ball when opponent is between the ball and the goal
* - should kick over ball in way at large distance from opponents goal
* - should kick over in way at small distance from opponents goal
* - should be able to kick into a very small goal, including coming from fetch-ball-near state
* - should be able to return to field at all sides
* - should detect that robot is out from front
* - should detect that robot is out from rear
* - should detect balls are out
